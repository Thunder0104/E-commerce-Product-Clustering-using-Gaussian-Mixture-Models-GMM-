# E-commerce-Product-Clustering-using-Gaussian-Mixture-Models-GMM-
This project focuses on applying Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to cluster e-commerce products based on their attributes. Using soft clustering, products are grouped into probabilistic clusters, allowing for overlapping categories and nuanced insights. Key metrics like Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) are used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results demonstrate how clustering can reveal patterns among products, which can be applied to real-world scenarios like targeted marketing, product recommendations, and inventory management. The project highlights the advantages of soft clustering over hard clustering, ensuring flexibility and better real-world data modeling.
